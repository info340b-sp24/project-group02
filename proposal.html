            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>One of the most important ways to minimize backyard breeding and the overabundance of animals in shelters is through pet adoption. Millions of pets enter shelters every year across the country, and many of these animals face the terrible prospect of never being adopted. In addition, the number of people who are permitted to adopt is limited. According to <a href="https://www.thesniff.com/blm/" target="_blank"></a>animal advocates from marginalized communities</a>, adoption requirements are used as a way to weed out adopters from marginalized groups. Shelters will refuse to consider people who don’t own their own home, who don’t have yards or fenced in yards, who live a certain number of miles from that community, etc. This system often prevents homes of marginalized communities (that can offer a safe and loving home) from adopting. Adoption platforms should be considering homes where the pet’s needs will be met and they will be loved. Things like whether or not a person has an established relationship with a vet shouldn’t change their eligibility for adoption. Not allowing marginalized communities to adopt is also harmful to the pets because it leaves them in shelters for longer and can lead to them being put down eventually due to severe space constraints.</p>
            <p>Online pet adoption has been pioneered by organizations like <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/" target="_blank">Petfinder</a> and <a href="https://www.adoptapet.com/?login=true&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=--19652064620&utm_term=adopt%20a%20pet&utm_content=647371975646&gclid=Cj0KCQjwn7mwBhCiARIsAGoxjaI7gyUWjUCPArT5OPCt5wEl_-jky9FuC6NKaqhB9XjMpYPLJ98GcWIaAuzUEALw_wcB&gad_source=1" target="_blank">Adopt-a-Pet</a>, but these platforms are not as transparent, making it more difficult for families of marginalized communities to be eligible to adopt. These systems aren’t upfront with helping potential adopters figure out how to make their home meet the needs of potential pets. In order to solve the current deficiencies in the pet adoption domain, our suggested solution, a Virtual Pet Adoption Platform, strives to close this gap by offering a dynamic, user-friendly interface that makes the process of choosing a new pet partner accessible and transparent.</p>

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>Our virtual platform for pet adoption caters to families and individuals who love animals. It emphasizes inclusivity as a means of combating the biases that are frequently observed in pet adoption procedures, particularly towards minorities. By providing equal access to adoption opportunities and information, the platform aims to establish a just and encouraging atmosphere for all potential pet owners. With instructional materials on pet care and adoption procedures, the application will offer a comprehensive database of available pets, complete with pictures, descriptions, and adoption requirements. This will improve the adoption experience by making the process more interactive and individualized in addition to meeting the need for thorough pet information.</p>
            <p>The main functions of the site are intended to promote transparency in the adoption process and accessibility for prospective adopters. Users can search for pets based on particular parameters with the query and filter system, making sure that the match fits their preferences and lifestyle. Users can make well-informed judgments by using this function in conjunction with the option to bookmark pets that they are interested in. The testimonial feature adds a community aspect, allowing users to share their adoption stories. This can help clarify the process and encourage others, specifically those from groups who might feel marginalized by traditional adoption channels, to adopt as well. Another feature is a form that users can fill out to determine if they are eligible to adopt. It would ask the users a series of questions, and then at the end it would either tell them they could adopt, or they could not adopt and why. This form would encourage transparency with the process and help make every family eligible for adoption.</p>
            <p>All of these features work together to make digital technology more approachable, accessible, and inclusive. We close the gap between pets and future pet owners by providing an engaging, user-friendly platform– one that fosters deep bonds that result in successful adoptions. Our dedication to diversity and inclusion makes sure that everyone feels welcome on the platform, addressing previous prejudices and promoting a fair adoption process./p>
